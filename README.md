# Stats_in_AI_ML

this contains various problems for the graphical models solving

1. calc-Partition-func-marcovnet :
    as the name suggest it a code that uses the variable elimination to calculate the partition function.
 
2. Sampling Markov Net:
    we are trying to compute the partition function by assumming the markov net and generating the probablities of 
    each evidance value for sample w_cutset size and repeatedly running the algorithm which we assume can get us near 
    possible partion value function
